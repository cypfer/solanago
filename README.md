 SolanaGo — Web3 Meets the Real World

SolanaGo is a mobile app that helps users discover, navigate, and interact with physical locations that accept Solana-based payments. Whether you're looking to spend SOL at a local café or attend a crypto-powered event, SolanaGo shows you where and how to spend your digital tokens in the real world.

Built with React Native and powered by Solana, Google Maps, and geolocation, this app bridges the gap between decentralised finance and everyday commerce.

Why SolanaGo?

Problem
Despite the growth of Web3, a significant disconnect remains between crypto users and real-world applications. Most people don’t know where they can spend their crypto, and most merchants have no simple tools to accept Solana-based payments in person.

 Solution
SolanaGo addresses this by creating a geo-aware, mobile-first platform that connects crypto holders with real-world opportunities to utilise their tokens meaningfully.
